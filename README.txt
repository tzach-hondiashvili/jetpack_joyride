Jetpack Joyride - Daniel Dalal & Tzach Hondiashvili

Jetpack Joyride is an exhilarating action game where players control a character equipped with a jetpack,
navigating through challenging environments, collecting coins, avoiding obstacles, and achieving high scores.
The game is developed using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and sound rendering.
The loading screen in Jetpack Joyride utilizes a separate thread for asynchronous resource loading. 
This approach ensures smooth performance and responsive gameplay, allowing players to interact with the game while textures, 
fonts, music, and sound effects are loaded in the background. It enhances user experience by reducing waiting times and optimizing the game's initialization phase.

Overview
In Jetpack Joyride, players take on the role of a character equipped with a powerful jetpack,
flying through dynamically generated levels filled with obstacles and rewards. 
The objective is to collect coins scattered throughout the game while avoiding collisions with zappers, missiles and other hazards. 
The game features an endless mode where players compete for the highest score by surviving as long as possible.

Features
Player Control: Navigate the character using keyboard space control to control the jetpack's thrust.
Collision Detection: Handle interactions between the player, obstacles, and collectible coins.
Game Objects: Zappers, coins, power-ups, missiles, speed boosts, and moving and static objects.
Scoring System: Track score based on collected coins and distance survived.
Sound Effects and Music: Integrated sounds for jetpack thrust, collision effects, and background music.
User Interface: Start and Help buttons, along with a score display and game instructions.

during the dvelopment of the project we faced a problem with identefying collisions accuratly,
we ended up finding a github reposetory that helped us with that.
